#URL-Detection-using-ML-and-Cryptogroaphic-TechniquesURL Detection using Machine Learning and Cryptographic Techniques
A project that uses machine learning and cryptographic techniques to detect malicious URLs.

#Description
This project aims to detect malicious URLs using a combination of machine learning algorithms and cryptographic techniques. The system takes a URL as input, extracts features from it, and then uses a trained model to predict whether the URL is malicious or not.

#Features
URL feature extraction: extracts features from the URL such as domain, path, query parameters, etc.
Machine learning model: uses a trained model to predict whether the URL is malicious or not
Cryptographic techniques: uses cryptographic techniques such as hashing and encryption to secure the system.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
scikit-learn library (install using pip install scikit-learn)
numpy library (install using pip install numpy)
pandas library (install using pip install pandas)
cryptography library (install using pip install cryptography)


#Usage
#URL Feature Extraction

import pandas as pd
from url_detection import URLFeatureExtractor

url = "https://www.example.com"
extractor = URLFeatureExtractor()
features = extractor.extract_features(url)
print(features)

#Machine Learning Model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from url_detection import URLDataset

# Load dataset
dataset = URLDataset()
X, y = dataset.load_data()

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(y_pred)

#Cryptographic Techniques

from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from url_detection import URLCryptographer

url = "https://www.example.com"
cryptographer = URLCryptographer()
encrypted_url = cryptographer.encrypt_url(url)
print(encrypted_url)

# Decrypt URL
decrypted_url = cryptographer.decrypt_url(encrypted_url)
print(decrypted_url)

#Dataset
